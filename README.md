# Covid-19 in India Analysis
## Summary

**Project Objective:** Analysing Covid-19 impacts in India across various dimensions including state-wise cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations, and demographic distribution. The objective is to gain insights into pandemic spread and response effectiveness.

**Data Source:** Covid-19 data across Indian states, including case counts, vaccination records, and demographic information.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Total deaths, Cases (confirmed, cured & deaths), Age group distribution, Gender distribution, Testing facilities, Vaccine doses administered (first and second doses), and State-specific testing details.

## Detailed Analysis
**Total Deaths by State.**

-Maharashtra had the highest total deaths, over 23 million. 

-Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh had notable high death counts.

-States with lower death counts were Ladakh and Lakshadweep with deaths under 4,000. 

**Covid Cases Over Time.**

-Confirmed Cases: Significant increase from 2020, reaching nearly 30 million by July 2021.

-Cured Cases: Almost parallel trend to confirmed cases, indicating strong recovery rates.

-Deaths: Steady rise, but much slower compared to confirmed and cured cases.

**Age Group Distribution.**

-20-29 Years: Largest affected group (24.86%).

-30-39 Years: Second largest group (21.10%).

-Senior Age Groups (60+): Represent 12.86%, indicating a higher risk among the younger population.

**ICMR Testing Labs by State:**

-Maharashtra had the highest number of ICMR labs (39).

-Tamil Nadu had the Second highest with 26 labs.

-Telangana had the third highest with 19 labs.

**Gender Distribution without Missing Values:**

-Male: Predominant gender affected (66.76%).

-Female: 33.24% of the reported cases, showing a lower impact compared to males.

**Vaccination Analysis (First vs. Second Dose):**

-First Dose: 56.5 million doses administered.

-Second Dose: Significantly lower, with 13.5 million doses administered.

**Doses Administered by Vaccine Type:**

-CoviShield: Most widely administered vaccine with 61.9 million doses.

-Covaxin: 7.96 million doses.

-Sputnik V: Least used vaccine with 28,918 doses administered.

**State-wise Testing Details:**

-Uttar Pradesh had the highest number of total samples tested.

-Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra had significant testing volume with a large proportion of negative cases.

-Dadra and Nagar Haaveli had lower testing volumes.

## Conclusion

The dashboard reveals high Covid-19 case counts and death rates in states like Maharashtra, while younger age groups are the most affected. Males are more impacted than females. Vaccination rollout is dominated by the first dose with CoviShield being the preferred vaccine. States with a higher number of testing labs, such as Maharashtra, show strong testing infrastructure.

## Recommendations
-**Increase Testing Capacity:** Expand ICMR labs in states with lower lab numbers, especially in heavily populated regions to improve testing coverage.

-**Focus on Second Dose Administration:** Encourage timely second dose administration through awareness campaigns to ensure better immunity coverage.

-**Expand Vaccine Choices:** Increase access to Covaxin and Sputnik V to provide more options and mitigate supply limitations with CoviShield.

-**Targeted Protection for Young Adults:** Focus on preventive measures and vaccination drives for the 20-39 age group, which shows the highest impact rate.

-**Monitoring and Support in High Death Count States:** Allocate more medical resources and implement stricter containment strategies in Maharashtra and other high-death states.
